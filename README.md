## XP Core Values Maintained

Communication: Communication was critical throughout the project to ensure that everyone was on the same page with the project's needs, timeframes, and progress. We used daily scrums, group chat, and calls to keep each other informed and involved. Each team member put conscious effort to communicate and keep track of status. 


Courage: From the first meeting, a space was created to allow for open conversations. We made the best use of the resources and skills that we all possessed while also improving all of our skill sets over time. We talked a lot about technology and architecture. We spent time improving our understanding while debating the optimal method. We had a few debates, but each person was free to propose the finest ideas that would be useful.
